Overview
Credit card is the most popular mode of payment. As the number of credit card users is rising world-wide, the identity theft is increased, and frauds are also increasing. In the virtual card purchase, only the card information is required such as card number, expiration date, secure code, etc. Such purchases are normally done on the Internet or over telephone. To commit fraud in these types of purchases, a person simply needs to know the card details.The mode of payment for online purchase is mostly done by credit card. The details of credit card should be kept private. To secure credit card privacy, the details should not be leaked. Different ways to steal credit card details are phishing websites, steal/lost credit cards, counterfeit credit cards, theft of card details, intercepted cards etc. For security purpose, the above things should be avoided. In online fraud, the transaction is made remotely and only the card’s details are needed. The simple way to detect this type of fraud is to analyze the spending patterns on every card and to figure out any variation to the “usual” spending patterns.Fraud detection by 
analyzing the existing data purchase of cardholder is the best way to reduce the rate of successful credit card frauds. As the data sets are not available and also the results are not disclosed to the public. The fraud cases should be detected from the available data sets known as the logged data and user behavior. At present, fraud detection has been implemented by a number of methods such as data mining, statistics, and artificial intelligence.

Objective 
As the world is rapidly moving towards digitization and money transactions are becoming cashless, the use of credit cards has rapidly increased. The fraud activities associated with it have also been increasing which leads to a huge loss to the financial institutions. Therefore, we need to analyze and detect the fraudulent transaction from the non-fraudulent ones. The main aim of the project is to develop a sophisticated system that can accurately identify and prevent fraudulent transactions. Here we implement different machine learning algorithms on an imbalanced dataset such as logistic regression and KNN. So different classification models are applied to the data and the model performance is evaluated on the basis of quantitative measurements such as accuracy, precision, score etc.The project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning and automating email notifications for timely alerts by cleaning and enhancing the dataset, creating new features, and addressing the imbalance between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, we improve the model's accuracy. We train and evaluate various machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious transactions effectively. Additionally, an email automation system is developed to notify stakeholders immediately about potential fraud, combining data science and automation for a robust and efficient fraud detection solution.

Existing System

•	Since the credit card fraud detection system is a highly researched field, there are many different algorithms and techniques for performing the credit card fraud detection system. 
•	One of the earliest systems is CCFD system using Markov model. Some other various existing algorithms used in the credit cards fraud detection system includes Cost sensitivedecision tree (CSDT). 
•	credit card fraud detection (CCFD) is also proposed by using neural networks. The existing credit card fraud detection system using neural network follows the whale swarmoptimization algorithm to obtain an incentive value. 
•	It the uses BP network to rectify the values which are found error.

         
Limitations 
If the time interval is too short, then Markov models are inappropriate
because the individual displacements are not random, but rather are deterministically related in time. This example suggests that Markov models are generally inappropriate over sufficiently short time intervals

Proposed System

Support Vector Machine:
SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data are transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane Training regression model and finding out the best one.
 

Random Forest Classifier 
Features are cheekbone to jaw width, width to upper facial height ratio, perimeter to area ratio, eye size, lower face to face height ratio, face width to lower face heightratio and mean of eyebrow height. The extracted features are normalized and finally subjected to support regression

 
Decision Tree 
A decision tree is a type of supervised machine learning used to categorize or make predictions based on how a previous set of questions were answered. The model is a form of supervised learning, meaning that the model is trained and tested on a set of data that contains the desired categorization.

 Advantages
•	Support vector machine works comparably well when there is an understandablemargin of dissociation  between classes.
•	SVM is effective in instances where the number of dimensions is larger than thenumber of specimens. 
•	Simple to understand and to interpret. 
•	Requires little data preparation. 
•	The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of datapoints used to train the tree. 
•	Able to handle both numerical and categorical data.
•	Random forest classifier can be used to solve for regression or classification problems. 
•	The random forest algorithm is made up of a collection of decision trees, and each tree in the ensemble is comprised of a data sample drawn from a training set with replacement, called the bootstrap sample.

TESTING
Testing is a process of executing a program with intent of finding an error. Testing presents an interesting anomaly for the software engineering. The goal of the software testing is to convince system developer and customers that the software is good enough for operational use. Testing is a process intended to build confidence in the software. Testing is a set of activities that can be planned in advance and conducted systematically. Software testing is often referred to as verification & validation. 
Unit Testing 
In this testing we test each module individually and integrate with the overall system. Unit testing focuses verification efforts on the smallest unit of software design in the module. This is also known as module testing. The module of the system is tested separately. This testing is carried out during programming stage itself. In this testing step each module is found to working satisfactorily as regard to the expected output from the module. There are some validation checks for fields also. It is very easy to find error debut in the system. 

Validation Testing 
At the culmination of the black box testing, software is completely assembled as a package, interfacing errors have been uncovered and corrected and a final series of software tests. Asking the user about the format required by system tests the output displayed or generated by the system under consideration. Here the output format is considered the of screen display. The output formaton the screen is found to be correct as the format was designed in the system phase according to the user need. For the hard copy also, the output comes out as specified by the user. Hence the output testing does not result in any correction in the system.

Functional Testing 
Functional tests provide systematic demonstrations that functions tested are available as specified by the business and technical requirements, system documentation, and user manuals. Functional testing is centered on the following items: 
Valid Input: identified classes of valid input must be accepted. 
Invalid Input: identified classes of invalid input must be rejected. 
Functions: identified functions must be exercised. 
Output: identified classes of application outputs must be exercised. 
Systems/Procedures: interfacing systems or procedures must be invoked. 

Integration Testing 
Data can be lost across an interface; one module can have an adverse effort on the other sub functions when combined may not produces the desired major functions. Integrated testing is the systematic testing for constructing the uncover errors within the interface. The testing was done with sample data. The Developed system has run successfully for this sample data. The need for integrated test is to find the overall system performance.

CONCLUSION
Nowadays, in the global computing environment, online payments are important, because online payments use only the credential information from the credit card to fulfill an application and then deduct money. Due to this reason, it is important to find the best solution to detect the maximum number of frauds in online systems. Accuracy, Error-rate, Sensitivity and Specificity are used to report the performance of the system to detect the fraud in the credit card.
The project successfully demonstrated the potential of machine learning models, particularly Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), for credit card fraud detection. Both models showed the ability to identify fraudulent transactions, proving their effectiveness in a crucial area of financial security. Logistic Regression offered clear interpretability with straightforward coefficients, while KNN provided flexibility by capturing complex data patterns. However, challenges such as data imbalance—where fraudulent transactions are significantly outnumbered by legitimate ones—affected model performance. Additionally, each model had inherent limitations: Logistic Regression's linear assumptions may not fully capture non-linear patterns, and KNN's sensitivity to feature scaling and computational demands posed scalability issues. Future improvements could involve ensemble methods that combine the strengths of both models to enhance overall performance. Moreover, incorporating additional features, such as user behavior patterns, could provide more context and further improve detection accuracy. Overall, while the initial results are promising, addressing these challenges through advanced techniques and richer feature sets is essential for developing more robust and effective fraud detection systems.
